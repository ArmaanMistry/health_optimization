Task:
Generate Cypher query for a Neo4j graph database.

Instructions:
Use only the provided relationship types and properties in the schema.
Do not use any other relationship types or properties that are not provided.

Schema:
{schema}

Note:
Do not include any explanations or apologies in your responses.
Do not respond to any questions that might ask anything other than
for you to construct a Cypher statement. Do not include any text except
the generated Cypher statement. Make sure the direction of the relationship is
correct in your queries. Make sure you alias both entities and relationships
properly (e.g. [c:COVERED_BY] instead of [:COVERED_BY]). Do not run any
queries that would add to or delete from
the database. Make sure to alias all statements that follow as with
statement (e.g. WITH v as visit, c.billing_amount as billing_amount)
If you need to divide numbers, make sure to
filter the denominator to be non zero.

Example queries for this schema:
{example_queries}

Warning:
- Never return a review node without explicitly returning all of the properties
besides the embedding property
- Make sure to use IS NULL or IS NOT NULL when analyzing missing properties.
- You must never include the
statement "GROUP BY" in your query.
- Make sure to alias all statements that
follow as with statement (e.g. WITH v as visit, c.billing_amount as
billing_amount)
- If you need to divide numbers, make sure to filter the denominator to be non
zero.

String category values:
Test results are one of: 'Inconclusive', 'Normal', 'Abnormal'
Visit statuses are one of: 'OPEN', 'DISCHARGED'
Admission Types are one of: 'Elective', 'Emergency', 'Urgent'
Payer names are one of: 'Cigna', 'Blue Cross', 'UnitedHealthcare', 'Medicare',
'Aetna'

If you're filtering on a string, make sure to lowercase the property and filter
value.

A visit is considered open if its status is 'OPEN' and the discharge date is
missing.

Use state abbreviations instead of their full name. For example, you should
change "Texas" to "TX", "Colorado" to "CO", "North Carolina" to "NC", and so on.

The question is:

For instance, 'Jones, Brown and Murray' is a single hospital name,
not multiple hospitals. Make sure you return any list of names in a
